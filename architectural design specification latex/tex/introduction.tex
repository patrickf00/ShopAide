Groco is a grocery shopping web application that is accessible on PC, smartphones, and tablets. The user of Groco will be able to search for the grocery items and based on the user's preference, the system will suggest the optimal grocery items. The system also allows users to search for recipes, add their recipes and meal plans into their shopping list to perform the optimization and navigation route.

The purpose of this product is to help users with grocery shopping. The key requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item searching for the item's availability in nearby stores
    \item comparing prices of the item in different stores
    \item comparing the distance to stores
    \item providing the convenience in planning meals
    \item providing optimal navigation route 
\end{itemize} 

The key requirement of this product is to optimize the grocery items based on users' preferences. The user's preferences include brand, number of stores, and max traveling distance. The user is allowed to choose the optimization by prices or distance.  

The scope of the product covers grocery stores that have their products and store information online and allow the third party access to request or collect data through their public API or web-scraping within the United States. The product prototype should be completed within the budget of 800 dollars and by April 20, 2022.

The main assumptions in this project are that users have internet access, the items' prices and store information collected online are accurate. Groco is not responsible for the price changes, stock-out at the stores. It is the user's responsibility to make sure that a price and discount offer is present at the stores since they are subject to change without notice.

The product contains no objectionable material; therefore it is suitable for general grocery shoppers and is made available publicly and free of charge for all users.

The final product will be tested and approved by the client. The developing team is free to decide which developing tools and programming languages to be used.
