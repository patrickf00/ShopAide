This section will cover all future requirements for this application. There is currently no plan to complete these requirements for the prototype version that will be completed for the scope of CSE 4316 and CSE 4317.

\subsection{There must be Android and iOS Applications}
\subsubsection{Description}
The prototype version, though accessible on Android and iOS devices, will only be accessible through the browser. Having applications for each type of mobile device is the highest priority of all future requirements. Having these applications will allow users to more easily access the application while creating a more efficient User Interface for mobile devices. The mobile applications should function exactly the same way on both mobile operating systems while looking as close to the same as possible, all of which should be the same as the web application.

UTA STeam
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The application will have to be developed for each operating system at the same time to ensure they perform and look the same. After completion of the mobile applications, they should be made available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. If any updates occur to the system, the team will have to ensure that they work and are pushed to the web, Android, and iOS applications at the same time.

\subsection{The application must generate revenue}
\subsubsection{Description}
This application has a lot of potential to generate revenue. The two main ways this can be done would be through data collection or membership access. Data collection could be useful to companies that want to track what certain demographics are shopping for, which zip codes people are shopping in, or how far people are will to drive for certain stores, etc. Memberships could allow for partnerships with other companies. This could allow certain people or companies to release cookbooks in the application, dietitians to create personalized meal plans for users, or allow stores to offer exclusive deals all of which would only be accessible to members.
\subsubsection{Source}
Customer
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The stakeholders must come to an agreement on how the application will generate revenue. If data collection is decided upon, the development team must ensure that all laws and regulations are followed and allow users to opt out of collection. If membership is chosen, the stakeholders must find partners that could make a membership worth the user's money.

\subsection{The application must allow users to rate recipes}
\subsubsection{Description}
Users will have the ability to rate recipes. The rating system will be a standard five-star system. This rating system will allow users to make the best choice when looking at similar recipes.
\subsubsection{Source}
UTA STeam
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The development team will have to find a way to prevent users from spamming recipes with five-star ratings to boost traffic to a recipe. There will also need to be a way to prevent users from spamming a recipe with bad reviews for illegitimate reasons.

\subsection{The application must allow users to review recipes}
\subsubsection{Description}
The review system will allow user to give any general comments about the recipe. This will also allow users to share their critiques, helpful tips, and recommendations. 
\subsubsection{Source}
UTA STeam
\subsubsection{Constraints}
There will have to be a way to regulate these comments to ensure that nothing offensive is said in the reviews. There should also be a way to ensure that these reviews are only relevant to the recipe.

\subsection{The application must allow users to report recipes}
\subsubsection{Description}
The recipe reporting system will allow users to report recipes. Once they are reported, someone within the team should be tasked with screening these reports to ensure their legitimacy. This reporting system will help the team ensure that shared recipes are in fact recipes, that recipes do not contain or create anything harmful or illegal, while also regulating any vulgar or offensive language that might appear in the recipes.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The team will have to regulate reporting to ensure that they are legitimate.

\subsection{The application will have an enhanced search algorithm}
\subsubsection{Description}
The algorithm for the prototype version of this application  will provide the most optimal grocery item based only on price and location. In the future, customers will be able to choose the criteria that chooses the optimal grocery item. This will allow users to give their own priority to brand, price, or location. The user will give a list of weights to each priority and the algorithm will prioritize based on those weights to give the optimal locations, items, and path.

Customer
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The team will have to create an algorithm that is able to change based on user preference.
