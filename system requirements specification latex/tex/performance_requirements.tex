Once a query is submitted, it can take no longer than four seconds.  
While the down time on the client can vary, on an average device in a cellular network it should take no more than two seconds, totalling at six seconds to complete.
In practice, caching will be an issue so it will not be uncommon for queries to take longer, but the average should be no less than six seconds.
