Groco aims to streamline the way we find recipes, make shopping lists, and find the best locations to buy ingredients.  We accomplish this buy having a centralized place for people to add, search, and view recipes.  Whenver a given user decides they like a recipe, the recipe can be added to their shopping list by the click of a button.  Whenever a user decides to to go shopping, by the click of a button they can be given a list of stores and items to shop at which is optimized by their shopping preferences.  Additionally, we add customization in the form of meal plans, which users can create and use as common collections of recipes that they can add to their shopping list when needed.
