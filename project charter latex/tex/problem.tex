This Project Charter establishes an agreement between UTA STeam and Tim Dockins to develop software to aid groceries shopping by finding the optimal route with the most savings. The existing software can only fulfill partial requirements of finding the lowest prices of the items but do not take into consideration of time and distance saving by suggesting the optimal route. UTA STeam is to develop software that accomplishes both tasks.
