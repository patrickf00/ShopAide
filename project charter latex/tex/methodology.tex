UTA STeam is going to build an application that is compatible with iOS and Android operating systems using N-tier architecture. The app will search for the items input by a user based on preference such as locations and brands to suggest the best places to shop these items with the lowest prices and fastest route. UTA STeam will utilize the Agile methodology which allows frequent alteration during the development process to accommodate continuous client feedback.
