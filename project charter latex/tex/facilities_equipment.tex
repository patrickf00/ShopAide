As this project is completely independant of any hardware components, our team does not require any lab space, makerspaces, or testing grounds. But for the purpose of our team meetings and to discuss sprint progress we have reserved a room in the Engineering Library for the rest of the semester. The only physical equipment that would be required for our project will be our phones and laptops for the application testing. We would be using Microsoft Teams for more regular communication and GitHub to collaborate on the source code for our application.
