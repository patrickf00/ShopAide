As this project is completely independant of any hardware components, the team does not require any lab space, makerspaces, or testing grounds. But for the purpose of the team meetings and to discuss sprint  Progress the team has reserved a room in the Engineering Library for the rest of the semester. The only physical equipment that would be required for the project will be the phones and laptops for the application testing. We would be using Microsoft Teams for more regular communication and GitHub to collaborate on the source code for the application.
