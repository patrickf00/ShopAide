The application will take into consideration of time, distance, and cost to suggest the optimal choice. By doing this, the application will help users to save money, time and avoid frustration such as going through bad traffic just to arrive at the store that do not carry the products that they want. Because this application will greatly benefit users, it will soon attract a lot of users, sponsors, and investors.
