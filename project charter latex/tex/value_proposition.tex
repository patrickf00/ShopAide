Technology has revolutionized all platforms including shopping. Furthermore, the thriving of mobile apps has significantly changed the way people shop today. Shoppers do not just go to the store and buy what is available there anymore. Now, they have an option to go online and check for availability and prices before they go. Many apps are helping with shopping including groceries; however, because the shoppers have many choices, it could be overwhelming and time-consuming since they have to look through many deals to compare and decide. There is also a high chance that the selected one might not be the best deal. This is when the groceries shopping aide that we are about to build becomes helpful and necessary. The app will take into consideration of time, distance, and cost to suggest the optimal choice. By doing this, the app will help users to save money, time and avoid frustration such as going through bad traffic just to arrive at the store that do not carry the products that they want. Because this app will greatly benefit users, it will soon attract a lot of users, sponsors, and investors. It can also be expanded to get subscriptions, referral marketing, advertising, collect and sell data.
