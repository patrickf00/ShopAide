As this is a software project with no hardware component most of our expenses will be for licensing and hosting the application. We will be hosting the back-end of the application on Heroku's Free tier hosting but later on as the user base increases we would have to choose a different tier level which could add to our cost. We would also need to buy a domain name for the web application part of the project. The cost for these items should be covered by the senior design spending budget.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
The primary source of funding for this project is the default \$800 budget provided by the CSE depart-
ment for senior design teams. As this project is not sponsored, there is no external funding for the
project. There is no other support, expected or needed, pending.
